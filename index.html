        <p>
        Just get over your todos, tasks, and move forward. This app provides you with the means to manage your work and plan to do them daily. We developed this app to handle our time during our Ph.D. program since we had a lot to do and had little time to perform them. I am sharing this app for free with you, hoping that it helps you as it allowed us to plan and move forward one step a time. I will try to answer your question and provide the best support possible. Please send me an email to alijenabid@icloud.com, or use the support menu under the setting.
        </p>
